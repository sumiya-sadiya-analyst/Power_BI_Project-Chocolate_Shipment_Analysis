# Chocolate Shipment Analysis
ðŸ“Š In this project, I developed an interactive Power BI dashboard using Excel as the data source for a global chocolate manufacturing company. The primary goal was to analyze shipment data to uncover actionable insights that support data-driven decision-making.
Key Focus Areas: - Shipment Analysis
                 - Shipment Trends
                 - Performance Insights

## Process
- Data Collection Stage: Gathered and imported the CSV files in power BI.
- Data Preparation stage: Cleaned the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, select relevant data types etc.
- Data Modeling Stage: Built star schema model where shipments data table represent "fact table" and oters are dimentional tables.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):Prepared several dashboards pages
